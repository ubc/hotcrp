# HotCRP OAuth

Configure HotCRP’s `$Opt["oAuthProviders"]` setting in `conf/options.php` to use
[OAuth 2.0][OAuth] and [OpenID Connect][] to authenticate users.

## `oAuthProviders` format

The `oAuthProviders` option is a [component list][components] of OAuth
authentication providers. Each `oAuthProviders` component should define:

* `name`: The name of the provider. Each provider must have a distinct name.
  Internal to HotCRP. Example: `"Google"`

* `title`: (Optional) A short description of the authentication provider, to
  be used in error messages. Defaults to `name`.

* `issuer`: (Optional) The issuer ID of the authentication provider. This is
  the value the provider sends as its `iss` claim in OAuth responses. If
  provided, HotCRP requires that ID tokens contain an `iss` claim that exactly
  matches this value. You can look it up the issuer for a provider by
  accessing an OpenID configuration file, such as
  https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. Example:
  `"https://accounts.google.com"`

* `client_id`, `client_secret`: Your client ID and secret. These are sent to
  the authentication provider as part of the authentication process.

* `auth_uri`: The provider’s authentication URI. Example:
  `"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"`

* `token_uri`: The provider’s URI for fetching authentication results.
  Example: `"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"`

* `redirect_uri`: (Optional) The HotCRP URI registered with the provider.
  Defaults to `SITEURL/oauth`.

* `scope`: (Optional) The OAuth scopes to be requested as part of the
  authentication process. Defaults to `"openid email profile"`

* `token_function`: (Optional) PHP callback to be called after a token is
  returned, but before HotCRP validates the token.

* `button_html`: HTML contents of the signin button for this provider. If
  empty, then HotCRP does not display a signin button. Example: `"Sign in with
  Google"`

* `disabled`: (Optional) If true, HotCRP disables this provider.

## Example configuration for Google authentication

```
$Opt["oAuthProviders"][] = '{
    "name": "Google",
    "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "client_id": "123456789-nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_secret": "GOCSPX-nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn",
    "button_html": "Sign in with Google"
}';
```

You’ll get the client ID and client secret from Google when you register your
application.

## Authentication flow

HotCRP’s page component `"signin/form/oauth"` renders a button for each
defined OAuth provider. Clicking on that button redirects to
`SITEURL/oauth?authtype=NAME&post=CSRFTOKEN`. That page initiates an OAuth 2
authorization code flow by choosing a random token, recording it, and
redirecting the user to the specified `auth_uri` with appropriate parameters.
When the user completes their authentication request, the provider redirects
back to HotCRP via the `redirect_uri`. HotCRP contacts the provider’s
`token_uri` with the provided parameters via an HTTP `POST` request with
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content. HotCRP then validates the
returned JWT and uses its `email` to authenticate the user.

Many steps in this process might go wrong. HotCRP uses its own code to
validate the JWT; this might break. HotCRP does not support encrypted tokens.
Report problems to maintainers.

HotCRP does not currently validate that the returned token was
cryptographically signed by a public key corresponding to the provider. That
is, it trusts that the TLS connection to the provider is secure, and does not
access the provider’s JSON Web Key Set.

## Disabling other authentication sources

Set `$Opt["loginType"]` to `"oauth"` to use *only* OAuth to authenticate
users. If `$Opt["loginType"]` is `"oauth"` or `"none"`, then HotCRP will not
use its own password storage or allow attempts to sign in other than through
OAuth.

## Importing group permissions

Group permissions can be imported from an openID provider if the token contains
a "group" claim. This can be configured via a "group mappings" setting in an
oAuthProvider setting:

```
$Opt["oAuthProviders"][] = '{
    "name": "Google",
    "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "client_id": "123456789-nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_secret": "GOCSPX-nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn",
    "button_html": "Sign in with Google",
    "remove_groups": true,
    "group_mappings": {
        "operators": "sysadmin",
        "reviewers": "pc",
        "chairs": "chair"
    }
}';
```

Setting `remove_groups` to `true` enables removing group permissions if these
are absent in the OpenID claim.
